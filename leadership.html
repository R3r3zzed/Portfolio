      <h2>ROTC Experience</h2>
      <img src="images/ROTC Group.jpg" alt="ROTC" class="responsive-image">
      <p>As a second-year cadet in UC Berkeley's Air Force ROTC program, I've rapidly advanced through various leadership positions within my flight, notably serving as the Flight Commander. Beyond my immediate responsibilities, I am actively involved with the Arnold Air Society, an honorary, professional, and service-oriented organization. 
        In my role as an Active Training Officer, I've been instrumental in designing and delivering projects and seminars with my three person team. 
        These initiatives are tailored to provide Active members of our squadron with diverse perspectives and methodologies, enhancing their leadership capabilities and strategic thinking.
        Notably, my commitment to excellence and leadership development has positioned me in the top third of cadets in my year. 
        This ranking is a testament to my dedication to both my personal growth and the mentorship of my peers, underscoring my potential as a future leader in the Air Force. </p>
